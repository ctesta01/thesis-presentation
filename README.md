This repository is for the Beamer presentation I will give as part of my undergraduate thesis defense. The subject of my thesis is elliptic curves. My talk, just like my thesis, will contain two major components: an explanation of the history of elliptic curves, and the conclusions of three experiments I have conducted as part of an investigation into how the infinite order rational points reduce into finite fields.

The major questions which I will answer are as follows:
- What is an elliptic curve? 
- Why do mathematicians care about them? 
- What do we know about them? 
- What makes them mysterious? 

An outline
